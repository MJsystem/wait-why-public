**“Wait, Why?” (WW) does not collect any data of any kind.**

- WW has no home server.
- WW doesn't embed any analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.
- WW doesn't accept donations or any other form of financing.

I just make this application for myself, so for now there is nothing except utility. (When something changed, you will know)

That is all.
